# GitHub Copilot: an AI pair programmer
When I’m writing code, Copilot works in the background by reading what I’ve written and quietly suggesting what I might want to write next.

Last year I said Copilot has improved my productivity by at least 30%. The real figure might be closer to 50%. I spend considerably less effort on the mundane and boilerplate, and I feel much more satisfied with the engaging bits of software engineering.
